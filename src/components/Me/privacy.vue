    <h1>Readward Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Readward Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you consent to share( “Mobile Application”).</p>
    <p>By using or accessing Readward, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>Readward collects personal information in the form of a Profile (Readward New Want, Readward My Want, Readward World’s Wants, Readward My Reply, Readward Promote Page and Readward Social Keywords). The User consents to upload and create a Readward Page with Readward. The User also consents to having the Profile accessible and available to all.</p>
    <p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
    <h3>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h3>
    <p>1. We collect information on Users in order to facilitate the operation of the Readward Platform.</p>
    <p>2. The User consents and knowingly chooses to disclose all information that is uploaded to the Readward Platform in the form of a Profile. When you add to your Profile with further information about yourself, you agree that any registration information you give to Readward will always be accurate, correct and up to date.</p>
    <p>3. The Readward Search Facility is available to all Users. Users are also invited to enter personal information which provides an enhanced set of search results.</p>
    <p class="p1">3.1 When you sign up for a Readward Account (or 'Readward') or other Readward services or promotions that require registration, we ask you for personal information such as name and email address. After you have created your Profile we provide you with the option to add additional personal information such as phone number. We may combine the information that you submit under your Profile with information from other Readward, in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services or to suggest to you people you might want to know, or other people who may have skills of interest to you. For certain information, we give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information within your account settings page.</p>
    <p class="p1">3.2 Readward provides an invitation service when you register with the Platform. If you choose (consent or opt in) to use our invitation service to tell a contact about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your contact’s email address or we will ask you to consent to having your contact list(s) imported. We will send your contacts an email in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and we will send additional reminders. Readward stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a contact connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent and to track the success of our referral program. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the same terms of this privacy policy as cover your own information. Readward also stores this information (imported contacts information) to avoid duplication of contacts and to check when contacts, not invited by the User, join the Readward Platform through registration. Readward will also store the User’s access details in order to synch the contacts whenever the User logs in.</p>
    <p class="p1">3.3 When you visit Readward, we use a third party tracking partner to gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
    <p class="p1">3.4 In addition, we store certain information from your browser using 'cookies'.</p>
    <p class="p1">3.5 When you use Readward, you may set up your Profile, form community networks, send messages, perform searches and queries, set up events, add applications, transmit information through various channels and send emails or other communications to Readward. We collect the personal information as outlined above so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your community network list.</p>
